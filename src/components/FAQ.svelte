		<div class="question">How do I get there?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<div>
				There's a whole bunch of people going from Sydney, so we'd encourage you to reach out to
				each other and carpool.
			</div>
			<div>
				There's also a train that can get you <i>somewhat</i> close.
			</div>
			<div>
				Note that the bus <b>doesn't</b> run on weekends, so let us know if you're taking that route
				and we can organize for you to be picked up from the station.
			</div>

		<div class="question">Do I need to stay nearby?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<div>
				We're starting the wedding a little before midday, and formalities will all be finished by
				5pm, so it should be pretty easy to do a day trip from Sydney.
			</div>
			<div>
				However if you want to stay nearby there's a few AirBnBs in the immediate vicinity and a
				bunch of hotels scattered throughout the mountains.
			</div>

		<div class="question">What do you mean by informal dinner on the schedule?</div>
		<div class="answer">
			<div>
				We'll be kicking on with a low-key barbeque since many of us are staying in the area.
			</div>
			<div>
				You're very welcome to join us, but please don't feel any pressure to - all the
				official parts of the day will be finished up before this.
